Data from [Masuzzo et al. 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep42383).

The sample included here is a small subset (only the first of 144 original frames is present) of the dataset corresponding to a single well from the plate used in the Ba/F3 experiment. In addition, the sample has been converted from the original plain TIFF format to [OME-TIFF](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/file-structure.html), in the binary-only + companion version.
