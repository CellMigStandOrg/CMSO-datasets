Data from [Masuzzo et al. 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep42383).

The above publication describes two experiments. Metadata included here refers to the first experiment on Ba/F3 cells.
Image data (not included here) consists of 12 144-frame TIFF movies, each relative to a well in a 48-well plate.

Currently, we have:

- An OME-TIFF companion XML file that groups the 12 image data files, including information on the plate layout
- An ISA-tab dataset containing the  experimental metadata, compliant with the MIACME minimum information guideline
- A biotracks datapackage containing TrackMate data
