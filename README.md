CMSO curated datasets
=====================

This repository contains metadata files for cell migration datasets curated by
the Cell Migration Standardisation Organisation (CMSO).

Each folder represents a given dataset and has a unique accession number.
Within each folder, the top-level README describes the dataset linking to the
reference  publication if available. The metadata files represent the three
units of information defined by CMSO:

- the experimental setup expressed using the ISA format
- the imaging metadata expressed using the OME-XML format
- the tracking data expressing using the CMSO Biotracks format
