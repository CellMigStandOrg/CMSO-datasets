CMSO curated datasets
=====================

This repository contains metadata files for cell migration datasets curated by
the Cell Migration Standardisation Organisation (CMSO).

Each folder represents a given dataset and has a unique accession number.
Within each folder, the top-level README describes the dataset linking to the
reference  publication if available. The metadata files represent the three
units of information defined by CMSO:

- the experimental setup, expressed using the [ISA](http://isa-tools.org) format
- the imaging metadata, expressed via [OME companion files](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/file-structure.html)
- the tracking data, expressed using the CMSO [Biotracks](https://github.com/CellMigStandOrg/biotracks) format
